# WIZ Micro Server

It allows installation on a MicroPython-compatible device, for example, the Raspberry Pi Pico. The main function is to address the connectionless and unreliable communication of Wiz devices, which relies on UDP packets. This server acts as a proxy by using HTTP over TCP and includes additional controls such as authentication.
